# EnergyCraft

A Minecraft 1.12.2 modpack inspired by classic Tekkit, built on IC2 Classic + BuildCraft with modern QoL improvements and meaningful end-game goals.

## Vision

EnergyCraft solves the "what now?" problem of tech modpacks by providing:
- **Clear Progression:** Early → Mid → Late → End-game with tangible milestones
- **Meaningful Power Sinks:** Your massive power infrastructure has PURPOSE
- **The Forge of Creation:** Draconic Evolution Fusion Crafting as the ultimate goal

## Core Mods

| Mod | Role |
|-----|------|
| IC2 Classic | Primary tech progression (EU power) |
| BuildCraft | Logistics and MJ power |
| Project Red | Redstone and wiring |
| ProjectE | EMC transmutation (balanced) |
| Draconic Evolution | End-game power sinks and goals |
| CC:Tweaked | Programmable computers and turtles |
